#ques1 In-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though non-constant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log n), though sometimes anything in O(n) (Smaller than linear) is allowed.

Examples of in place Sorting Algorithms:-

1.Bubble Sort
2.Heap Sort
3.Insertion Sort
4.Quick Sort
5.Selection sort
Examples of out place Algorithms :-

1.Merge Sort
2.Radix Sort

        key = array[step]
        j = step - 1
        
        # Compare key with each element on the left of it until an element smaller than it is found
        # For descending order, change key<array[j] to key>array[j].        
        while j >= 0 and key < array[j]:
            array[j + 1] = array[j]
            j = j - 1
        
        # Place key at after the element just smaller than it.
        array[j + 1] = key
